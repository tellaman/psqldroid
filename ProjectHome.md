Postgresql is a very powerful database engine in use globally. Several entities have tried to adapt a client for postgresql on Android using methods ranging from psql over ssh, to various java libraries, to web-based proxies, and so on.

Most of those attempts were made assuming that compiling libpsql and psql for Android would be too difficult. Although it was not exactly easy, and there are still some features to add, this project should enable interested parties to use postgresql in Android natively.

Note, this software _should_ be licensed under the PostgreSQL License. However, it does not seem to be an available option on Google Code at the moment.
